Object-oriented programming in the shell.

Code here implements what's described in the 1994 USENIX Summer Technical Conference paper,
which can be found in this repo, in *paper/new-oo-programming-language-sh.ps* .

PostScript readers are no longer ubiquitous,
but the same paper is also available from [Google Drive, here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15V1C_xkon7TwFyoi2H17rlUbK_I1fKe_/view?usp=sharing),
which seems to display PostScript successfully.
